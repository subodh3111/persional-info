I have always believed that insights derived from data are not just numbers; they are strategies, innovations, and sometimes even life-saving interventions. This belief continuously drives me to enhance my skills and broaden my horizons in this field.
Journey into Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Machine learning introduced me to the beautiful world of intelligent systems — systems that learn and adapt without explicit programming. The first time I trained a simple classification model, the thrill of watching a machine learn from data was unforgettable. It marked the beginning of a deeper journey into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
My academic and professional projects allowed me to work with classic algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting. Over time, I transitioned into deep learning, where neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers opened an entirely new dimension of possibilities.
Understanding how machines can recognize images, translate languages, and generate human-like text was both intellectually stimulating and professionally rewarding. I realized that the frontier of AI is limitless — and I wanted to be an integral part of this evolving story.
Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs) and RAG Applications
In recent years, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how machines interact with human language. While proprietary models like GPT have led the charge, I found myself particularly drawn to open-source LLMs.
I explored models like Meta’s Llama 2, Mistral, and OpenAssistant — powerful alternatives that democratized access to cutting-edge AI capabilities without the prohibitive cost barriers.
My work involved fine-tuning open-source LLMs for domain-specific applications, understanding tokenization, training dynamics, inference optimization, and deployment. I also ventured into building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, where the synergy between retrieval systems (like FAISS) and generative models creates scalable, knowledge-grounded chatbots and intelligent assistants.
By blending vector databases with language models, I could develop systems that first retrieve the most relevant knowledge chunks from large datasets and then generate highly accurate, contextually relevant responses. This architecture enhanced the reliability of LLM outputs and opened up vast possibilities for enterprise-grade search engines, customer support systems, and educational bots.
Through these projects, I gained a deeper appreciation of the balance between model-centric AI (improving model performance) and data-centric AI (improving data quality and retrieval strategies).
Building Predictive Models and Pipelines
Another area that strongly resonates with me is predictive modeling — the art of forecasting future outcomes based on historical data.
Be it sales forecasting, churn prediction, stock price movement, or disease outbreak prediction, predictive modeling turns data into foresight.
I developed a keen interest in the entire lifecycle of predictive systems:
Problem Definition: Understanding the business or societal problem to model
